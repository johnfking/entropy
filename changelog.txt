known bugs
--------------------
epics with commas in their names are currently not functioning
--------------------

200813.01
- zerker
  put engine3 back into its main class routine
  finished moving remaining AAs to the DB
  should engage in combat again. wasnt my fault.. honestly!
- rez
  complete redesign of the priority loop
  /rez line - alter the order of the priorites
  /rez # - (on/off) switch for a specific priority
  /rez list - lsit all the stuffs
  and so on, like most of the normal commands
  removed the /corpse component dor now. so it will rez the corpse in place
- /burn spinup wont kill your goldfish anymore
- taunt
  moved to /agro
  moved the activation out of melee skills into its own sub (testing with pally)
- paladin
  some minor alterations to combat flow



200810.01
- /entropy concolor - on/off will use the targets concolor for display
- /agro
  /cc melee taunt and /cc agro have been moved to the /agro control
  /agro active - on/off switch for using a class agro skills to be the big dick
  /agro taunt - has been changed from on/off to a ##% (0-99). 0 for off
  you will need to reset the value on your tanks, make it as aggressive as you like now
- /rez ic should work properly now


200808.01
- voodoo
  moved the MS delay time to swap weapons out to the DB.
  its in maHard if you want to edit it.
- /chr
  all class controls adjusted to be more uniform
- beastlord
  moved all AAs to the DB
- corrected several more missed sub names


200807.03
- in this corner we have the bard standing at lvl 112
  and in the opposing corner we havve a bloodied and beaten exspes..
- bards
  will now obey the /chr refresh time for their songs. it is in seconds btw..
  complete redesign for the bard swap. blame dannuic for this
  it is now based entirely off IDs. should be no more problems with matching
- sqlite
  zone data should account for locked files


200807.01
** TLP QoL round 2
- bard instrument swapping
  /chr swap [active|primary|secondary]
  active - the on/off switch for using instrument swapping
  primary - your primary weapon
  secondary - your secondary weapon
  No, i dont want to use a bandolier for this.
  /chr scan - will rescan your inventory for the best instrument mods (or you can restart)

  On macro start, the bard will scan its inventory and creat a map of the best instrument mods it has.
  When the bard goes to play a song, if there is a swappable instrument for that song type, that is
  not already equiped, it will swap the instrument out in the last 1.5 seconds of the song cast.
  After the song finishes, it will immediately swap the weapons back.
  This process continues for every song cast.

- druid
  corrected the burn sub name
- paladin
  fixed the pally agro sub name /sigh
- /admin pregen
  this will force an update of all the pregen data (spells/AAs/Discs/Songs)
  that entropy populates for you, to what you currently have in your book for you level.
  It will NOT reset things like /buffs /chr or other control settings.
  JUST the pregenerated data.


200805.01
** The long awaited TLP edition
- gem mem routine
  increased the base wait time to allow for extended mem time spells
- enchanter
  corected the sub name for mis_combat()
- rest
  corrected the heal check sub names
- peeps should no longer try to melee when its turned off
- adjusted the distance option for pulling with melee
  it will no longer obey the /cc pull navstop distance option
  its stop distance is now default 80% of the targets max melee range
- DB pregen entries where a toon is too low to have any of the spell family
  line will now default to FALSE


200804.02
- wizard
  corrected the class init sub name


200804.01
- ranger
  moved the remainder of the AAs into the DB
  added back in ToT healing. i dont know where it went. dont ask..
- rezing
  corrections to the rez priority loop
  relocated an errant /declare. it was unhappy in its current position
- all classes
  converted to the new parsed #include design
- sqlite
  pragma=WALL has been added to all shared databases
- /mode farm
  rof_shard_bodhe - some more small adjustments
  5 tears of alaris completed now..
- loot
  if you have something checked in the advloot window
  like Always Greed, or Need, it will override the
  database settings and use advloot like you have it checked.
  should be a little faster too
- /chr invis [self|group|selfivu|groupivu] [name]
  currently this setting is only being used in /mode, but it
  will be expanded as needed. next stop is the /invis command


200801.01
- bard
  fixed the singing in combat... again..
- /mode farm
  rof_shard_bodhe - a lot of small fixes
- /navto now takes an optional invis switch
  /navto [target|spawn|wp|loc] [name] [invis]
  RNG/DRU/SHD will use their instant single invis AAs. everyone else is hardcoded to Cloudy Potions
  if you dont have access to these, sorry. this overrides the nocast while moving, so it has to be
  an instant cast invis


200728.01
- bard
  fixed the bard pulseincombat tag, it should do things in combat now
  moved all AAs to the DB
- /mode farm
  rof_shard_bodhe - will farm the quest in Shards Landing - Fear Begins at Home
  this is the no down time quest for shard farming for the tear.
  i highly advise you have a metric fucktonne of invis pots on you
  notes:
  - use at your own risk
  - if you cant solo these mobs normally, get a dps merc up or a healer
  - if you get to less then 40 Cloudy Potions, it will end
  - if your mesh sucks, it will do sucky things
- removed the stupid here echo in casting


200727.01

  https://entropy.exspes.com/wiki/index.php/Rezing
- all rez data has been moved to the environment_rez table in the character DB.
  you will need to reset your /rez options.
- you can now control the priority spawn search strings for rezing. there are 8 available
  the first 6 match how rezing has always been done. change them at your own peril
  the remaining 2 are unused, for now
- all classes now have access to:
  lsRezIC - list of things to rez incombat with
  lsRezOOC - list of things to rez with while out of combat
  if you are not a rezing class, these lists will be EMPTY by default.
  if you are a rezing class, these lists will be populated with the default rez AAs

- /area see
  shows all the name settings for the current zone
- healing::dannet

	.. this is a completely different approach. so, will have to see how it goes for a bit

  round three of: Dear god quit chain casting invis...
- safezones
  corrected an issue were the safezone DB field wasnt being generated on entering a new missions

  corrected assist info for alliances
- removed a castresult reset from the start of voodoo(). i'm not convinced this is the aa spam

- tags
  i've added a few dannet variables for tag usage. they are in the form of toonname_TLO, like so

  mike_PctHPs - Mikes current Hit Point percent. returns int
  bob_PctMana - Bobs current Mana percent. returns int
  tom_PctEndurance - Toms current Endurance percent. returns int
  * NOTE, the character name has to be lowercase.
  I can open more on request


200712.02
- /heal break
  will watch the intended targets health. if it happens to hit the healpoint you have set for that class
  it will stop the cast and move on. the HP check is 3/second. this is only applied to spells and not
  items being used for healing.
- /buff shrink
  corrected a bad variable from all the tag changes
- redesign of mac start options
  https://entropy.exspes.com/wiki/index.php/Install#options


200712.01

  should be a lot more aggressive using paragon for group members
- voodoo()
  some corrections made so it will let casts be completed on corpses for rezing
- /build

200710.01
- removed pet targeting requirements for buff checking (some peoples kids...)
- tag
  nuke::totem - marker for totem type spells, like shaman debuff totem, or necro skull aura totems.
- worked around a _bug_ thats causing some variables to not get defined properly
  things like curing and mana regen clicks will work again.. for now
- shaman
  shoudnt spam its checking its pet all the time
- bard
  removed an extra FALSE that was doing absolutly nothing. i mean, it could have just stayed ther forever


200709.02
- engage % logic issues
  so, toons with /cc mode heal and CC enabled, were getting past the engage % checks and going balls deep soon
  as something was targeted when they also had nuking/dotting/melee enabled. this should be resolved. now, they
  should only go balls deep with written permission
- tags
  more were found in buffing other merc/RL players. they have been corrected
- reversed the loginc in check_class_loop() so FALSE is actually bad now. not sure why it was good before


200709.01
- tags
  still missed a couple.. soo damn many of them.. #alwaysknightlysfault
  redesigned the class tag checks.. might work, might not. /shrug
  added in a twincast marker for twincast nukes
  corrected the nosafezone tag
  deleteing a tag will not readd it instantly as a delete evaluation
  removed the debug from deletes

  added:
	/tag buff::assist::your assist
	/tag heal::assist::your assist

- healing
  should break sooner when the threshold is reached for the grouphurt count to do a gorup heal
- bard
  corrected (read deleted) some old condition calls
- sql inits
  reversed the checks from errors 5/6 for fails on a db write to a 0 for a pass


200708.01
- /song list
  was counting too high. shouldnt error anymore
- zerkers
  now have a target for aa battle leap
- /entropy
  removed the dpsmeter option
- tags
  corrected the function calls to reflect new tag names for every class


200706.01
- lsProtectOutsideGroup - is now the only list for adding Players/NPCs to your XTarget list for healing
- /line command has been removed
  it is now part of the / commands that can use lines. for example.
  /heal line #|#|#|#|#
- popups (can't believe i'm doing this)
  there is now a popup for the /env auto command, showing its state
  when you start using the console in MQ2Next, it will make more sense

** tags and conditions.. you should probably read this. i mean, you dont have to, but it might help
** I broke all of your tags again.. sorry not sorry?
- conditions have been removed from Entropy. well, they are still there for reference. but the code no longer uses them
  so you can still do a /condition and see a list of the conditions you had created, but thats all it will do

- tags have now replaced conditions
  a tag contains 3 parts: its grouping, its name, and its evaluation
  example:
  buff::nocombat::!${Select[${Me.CombatState},combat]} && !${SpawnCount[npc radius ${maEnv.Find[stEnvSafeRadius].Value} playerstate 4]}
  groupings are limited and cannot be changed. and example of a grouping is buff or heal or nuke
  the tag name, there are some defaults, and others you can make. you cannot edit the defaults, you can make as many as you like
  the evalutaion is what you are checking, like "${Me.PctHPs} < 15"

  to create a tag you would do something like:
  /tag nuke novermin "${Me.House.RacoonBreakingIn} > 11pm"
  this would creat a tag for nukes that will kill the damn trashpanda that keeps getting in my cat door at nights.

- /tag
  /tag list - shows all tags/evals for all groupings
  /tag list heal - shows all tags/evals for the heal group
	/tag list 2 - shows only the tags/evals you have created

  /tag heal panic delete - will delete the panic evaluation from heals
  /tag panic delete - will delete the panic tag name.

  tags names have some basic colors to them
  green - default ones for use
  brown - markers for things like heal:self or buff:crew
  cyan - tags i did not include as markers or defualts (basically, yours or errors)

  NOTES:
  you cannot delete tag name without deleting the evaluation from all the groupings it is in first. if you try, it will yell at you
  you can have the same tag name in different groups doing different things
  there is no limit to the number of tags you can make
  to correct a tag evaluation, simply remake it
  any invalid tags will show some very irritating red warning notices, often
  as normal, it is up to you to create the evaluations correctly. ${Tuesday.Tacos} is not a valid eval, even though it should be
  tags are still applied the same way to things like /buff or /heal example
  /buff 1 tag tacos add

- curing is back on the plate and a lot more aggressive
  setting self only cures will no longer trigger crew observers
- berserker
  corrected the checks for Drawn to Blood so it can fire again
- bard
  added endurance check for AA boastful bellow
- Engine 3 has been added to all classes

  added in additional check for hidecorpse on the pull wait loop

  adjustment to relative path locations in preparation for MQ2Next


B200519.01

- cleric and shaman
  added a timer for regen (single and group) checks. default is every 3 seconds
  the routine check was simply consuming too much of the healers time

  scenario: 2 groups. 1 is a mob control group other is dps. dps group all assist the group ma

  keeping all group exp to the dps group and avoiding a raid configuration

  cleric using Aura of the Reverent can use condition:

  due to the DBG fucked up naming convention
- conditions
  i've built in the math.calc calculation into the condition check routine
  you should be able to go back to writing normal conditions an having them function as designed
  i'll leave it like this till the MQ issue is sorted (if ever...)

  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
  navpull has been adjusted so if you turn off the following
  /cc pull sethome
  /cc home incombat
  and clear your home marker /home clear
  nav pull will just wander to every mob and kill it.
	if you set the same settings for everyone your group and tie to the nav puller its kind of fun to watch
- nav pull wait time is now based off pull range and mob distance like all the pull modes
- /entropy buffcooldownwait
  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
  this switch forces a gem cooldown delay in order to force complete buff cycles w/o skiping to the next available buff
  THIS WILL slow down your toons response time as they will not break buff cycles (by default) on spell cooldowns
  it is applied to auras, minion, self, crew buffing
- healing (brace yourself)
	increased the heal map from 20 to 50
	the /heal map now covers target of target heals, splash heals (not surge thats later), regen heals (group and single), group heals, pet heals,

  you can still set pull ranges well in excess of 200
  you will get as close as you have set /cc pull navstop
  LoS is not a requirement
