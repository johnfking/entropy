- removed the exact matching for buff removal

- class routines exposed: 
  Warrior, Wizard, Shadow Knight, Shaman
- debuffs
  to account for the issues with debuffs of matching names; like Malaise
  debuffs are now cast by ID.
  in order to do this, i have exposed the search order for finding what to use first
- cast type search order
  when matching names of different types are encounters, this is the order of usage:
  lsOrderCastType::alt|pulse|spell|disc|item
  yes, you can change the order
  yes, you can remove things you dont use. tanks dont really need to be checking songs and so on
  no, you cannot make thing up and put them in there
- voodoo()
  considerable redesign of the sub
- is_ready()
  adapted to account for lsOrderCastType and user selections
- no casting with specific buffs on
  lsNoCastBuff::fill this with a list of buffs/songs you do not want to cast while they are on, and you wont cast  
- corrected some Me.Book issues
- mezing
  changes to account for non ae mezing on TLP (seriously do they even CC?)

- corrected a debug error with /melee


210216.01
- Next Users
  make sure the plugin MQ2Lua is loaded
  if its not, the macro is gonna yell at you...!
- in macro help
  a LOT (read almost all) in macro help has been migrated to MQ2Lua
  Translation:
    those running normal MQ2 will not be able to use in macro help
    people running Next, need to load MQ2Lua plugin
    help can be accessed in two ways.
      /command -h - will give you basic help/summary for that command
      /command -u - will let you see usage for that command
      /command -s - will show you the map associated with that command (if there is one)
    or
      /-h will show you all the commands you can get help on
      /-h command will show you usage and help for that command
  NOTE: the ingame help is a summary of whats in the wiki. the wiki will remain 
  the source for detailed documented help

  and the spell would be memed to be cast and not the item. repeat after me, TLP issues
- class orders exposed
  druid, magician, necromancer
- necromancer
  corrected swblood to swBlood
  bloom % is now gather % 
- cleric
  unbroke their /chr control  
- healing: dannet
  i might have actually fixed the divide by 0 error.. maybe..
- combat positioning
  /home movebehind has been removed
  /home position [free|left|right|face|rear]
  free - simply sticks to the target during combat, doesnt care where
  face - sticks to the front of the mob
  rear - sticks to the rear of the mob
  left - (currently broken) sticks you to the right side of the mob
  right - (currently broken) sticks you to the left side of the mob
  note: yes i know left and right are not doing what they are supposed to do. blame mq2moveutils
  note2: you will need to reset your toons that used movebehind
  

210208.01

  cleric: /chr mcr (celestial regeneration)

- events

  "should" prevent events from flying by


210206.01
- pet weapon begging
  classes will not beg if you do not have a mage running or they are not in same zone
- /override targetclear (on/off)
  this will override the mechanics of keeping a target clear. more noticable with healers than other classes
  on a personal note:
    like all overrides. if you use this and it causes you issues, or you dont like it. dont use it
    this is in direct conflit with a lot of the mechanics of how entropy operates
- /gather
  small adjustment to the broadcast options

  
210205.01
- bard
  (yes.. even more corrections)
  i better be getting some cookies for this

  re-hardcoded stAugmentedFrenzy
- debuffing
  changing the approach a little
  when debuff values are checked for multi landing debuffs, if one of the landing debuffs is
  missing or less it will still attempt to cast regardless if the other trigger debuffs are better
  basically the same idea behind multi landing buffs
- open /cc mode heal back up to all classes. if you wannd do bad things, thats on you
- /gather - pulls all your people to you depending on options
  /gather [all|group|zone|raid] - force a type of gather
  /gather broadcast [all|group|zone|raid] - set the defaulkt gather type
  this is being pulled from /home gather. decided i wanted it as it's own command
  follows all the normal broadcast options for commands
- increased the delay for group/other buffing to get the buffs populated

210126.01
- unfucked curing on mac start
- cleric
  wont waste battle frenzy aa anymore
  
- class orders
  all the classes are set up 4 stages:
    what they do all the time while in auto
    what they do pre combat
    what they do while in combat
    what they do at the end of a combat loop

  i have started to expose these routines so you can change the order of exectuion
  following the same class routine order:
    lsOrderClassBase
    lsOrderClassPre
    lsOrderClass
    lsOrderClassPost

  so, for a rogue, the combat order would be lsOrderClass::melee|burn|misc|debuff|alliance|item|nuke|dot
  they will use whatever they have turned on in that list, skipping it otherwise
  
  as of this update, i have 6 classes converted: cleric, paladin, enchanter, rogue, ranger, beastlord
  you can see the class order by doing: /chr list
  for classes not converted yet, this is not an option
  the initial default orders will follow how the class operates currently
  
  i will have a wiki update as to all the available options for class orders and their restrictions

- mana class check added for nuking mana % stop
- all overrides that are enabled will be displayed at the macro start
- pull
  added a los check for additional pullers to engage
  some small changes to how pullers wait for mobs get back to camp on a pull
  disabled arc pulling till i can figure out why my math sucks
- buffing
  group and raid are now adapted to use SPA to get best spell in book
- CC shouldnt lock targets while invis anymore
- /entropy dannet
  nettimeout ## - will adjust observer delay (10ths/second)
  querydelay ## - will adjust the max time to wait for a response from a query (10ths/second)
- corrected a collections crash in single/no entry commands

- there has been a complete rewrite of the /crew command and EVERYTHING associated with it
  - channel communication
  - group formation
  - available roles
  - shared data
  the following is a summary of the new commands
  i suggest you read the wiki for a full description
  
  /crew add character - creates character in db (this is also done auto on login for that toon)
  /crew add crewname - adds a crewname to the database
  /crew add member - adds a character to a crewname
  /crew add role - adds a character to a role ( leader, assist, so on)
  /crew list - NA|crewname
  /crew delete crewname - deletes a crewname and all associated roles
  /crew delete role - deletes a character role from a crewname
  /crew form name - forms a crewname and assigns roles

- commands: /here /take /enter /on /off
  now have the following options
  all - covers all toons in your entropyall dannet channel
  group - covers your group members
  zone - all dannet members in your zone
  raid - all dannet members in your raid
  the commands /here /on /off are not executed by the issuer as usual
  you can set a default channel for each of these commands as well
  a command issued w/o an option will execute the default option
  eg. /here broadcast [group|raid|zone|all]
  

201126.01
- controls that have list additions will not show [list] in the options
- override splashhurt
  allows a cleric to ignore the hurt counters and maintain a constant splash routine
- magician
  cosmetic changes to the class controls to match the last set of changes
- cleric

  cosmetic changes to the class controls to match the last set of changes
- moved all dannet query delay times to the DB.
- corrected DB pathings to account for spaces
- corrected INI pathings to account for spaces
- small change to loot auto delete


201123.04
- corrected a targeting issue for self only buffs on the new temp buff routine.


201123.03
- /mode petfarm - some small fixes
- /debuff tash
  corected the display output for the control
- temp buffing
  (might wanna sit down for this)
  all class temp buff references have been removed from their character databases
  (this does not include knight rune line)  
  a marker tag has been added for temp buffs
  tag::buff::temp
  temp buffing follows the same tag rules an any other buff
  temp buffs are by default on a 30 second timer
  only one (1) temp buff will be cast per 30 seconds. this is intentional
  they are only cast while in combat (cleric is the 1 exception to this)
  temp buffing is only for people you box, in your dannet, not your next door neighbor
  this does not work on pets. no, i'm not gonna make it work on pets
  temp buffing does not split apart spell SPAs, if you need that, stick with normal buffing
- tags
  added - pull - category for pull tags
  added - tag::buff::temp for temp buff marker
  tags will now accept character names
  READ THIS! if you fuck it up, its on you..
  to create a tag for a toon it MUST follow this pattern:
  /tag buff Toonname "marker name"
  e.g. /tag buff Fred "marker name"
  DO NOT deviate from that pattern. if you do, the tag will not work, and the 
  filters for /build save will not catch it causing you to share your character names with others
- /build save
  will filter out (read as; completely remove) all tags with the eval set to "marker name"
  

201120.01

200928.01
- monks

- /entropy loopdelay #
  0-9 (default 1) 0 being off
  changes the main loop delay of the macro. this is in 1/10ths of a second
  this is the number of cycles the main macro loop does. the higher the number the less loops
  the default of 1 is 10 cycles per second, a 5 would be 2 cycles per second
  adjust this, ONLY if you are experiencing a FPS drop
  NEVER take past 9. i honestly wouldnt advise going over a 5
- /mode petfarm
  some updates to the pulling
- pullin (no not that)
  /pull - now contains all the commands and controlls for whomever is puling.
  it is also a line of usable things to pull with when using /pull with other

	 the design is just like nukes or dots.
	 i will update the wiki slowly.. er shortly..

200827.02
- missed a debug


200827.01
- buffing should account for those of you that do not have full access toons
- pets (minions)
  i have removed stPetType
  all pet classes will now simply use the best pet in their book
  mages can choose by elemet type
- magician
  /chr pettype [air|earth|fire|water] - set type type of pet you want to summon
- all classes
  removed a bunch of old commented code
- tags
  writing over/correcting a tag you created will clear the running variable that stores it


200824.01
- corrected a target ID detour in engine2
- added oodles more death checks
- warrior
  corrected a target call in main loop taunt
- ranger
  changed the summer switch to an int. you can set # of mobs in area to start using summer nuke. 0=off

- testing a new way to enter buffs
  instead of using the spell name, you are entering three paramaters to help narrow down the spell
  |one = the .TargetType of the casting spell
  |two = the .SubCategory the casting spell belongs too
  |three = the attribute name we want to look for to filter out the best spell.

  the following examples will find the best version of the spell you have in your book

 -eg1: cleric single Righteousness
  /buff 1 "|Single|Aegolism|Max HP"
  in this example we use the proc Righteousness which has an attribute Max HP
 -eg2: paladin brells
  /buff 2 "|Group V2|HP type two|Max HP"
 -eg3: chanter group haste
  /buff 1 "|Group V2|Haste|AGI"
  for this one we look at the AGI stat as the measure since melee speed incerase stops at 68% around lvl 95
  you could use any of the stat bonues. AGI was just an arbitrary choice
 -eg4: chanter single mana regen
  /buff 3 "|Single|Mana|Max Mana"
 -eg5: chanter Legion group rune line
  /buff 10 "|Group V1|Spell Guard|Spell Guard"
 -eg6 chanter group mana
  /buff 1 "|Group V2|Mana|Max Mana"
 -eg7: ranger enrichment line
  /buff 13 "|Group V1|Combat Abilities|Fc_BaseEffects"

  Notes: This does not replace the current system of buffs or alter it in any way. This is a test run,
  I'm not completely sure how well this will adapt, but.. I have been running this on 5 of 6 toons for a
  couple days now and have noticed no hits in performance.
  you can find out all the information about a spell with the command /admin spa "FULL SPELL AND RANK NAME"
  This only works on spells in books. Not AAs/discs/items, I'll look into those later.

  will now obey the /chr refresh time for their songs. it is in seconds btw..
  complete redesign for the bard swap. blame dannuic for this

  zone data should account for locked files


200807.01
** TLP QoL round 2
- bard instrument swapping
  /chr swap [active|primary|secondary]
  active - the on/off switch for using instrument swapping
  primary - your primary weapon
  secondary - your secondary weapon
  No, i dont want to use a bandolier for this.
  /chr scan - will rescan your inventory for the best instrument mods (or you can restart)

  On macro start, the bard will scan its inventory and creat a map of the best instrument mods it has.
  When the bard goes to play a song, if there is a swappable instrument for that song type, that is
  not already equiped, it will swap the instrument out in the last 1.5 seconds of the song cast.
  After the song finishes, it will immediately swap the weapons back.
  This process continues for every song cast.

- druid
  corrected the burn sub name
- paladin
  fixed the pally agro sub name /sigh
- /admin pregen
  this will force an update of all the pregen data (spells/AAs/Discs/Songs)
  that entropy populates for you, to what you currently have in your book for you level.
  It will NOT reset things like /buffs /chr or other control settings.
  JUST the pregenerated data.

  like Always Greed, or Need, it will override the
  database settings and use advloot like you have it checked.
  should be a little faster too
- /chr invis [self|group|selfivu|groupivu] [name]
  currently this setting is only being used in /mode, but it
  will be expanded as needed. next stop is the /invis command

- /mode farm
  rof_shard_bodhe - a lot of small fixes
- /navto now takes an optional invis switch
  /navto [target|spawn|wp|loc] [name] [invis]
  RNG/DRU/SHD will use their instant single invis AAs. everyone else is hardcoded to Cloudy Potions
  if you dont have access to these, sorry. this overrides the nocast while moving, so it has to be
  an instant cast invis


200728.01
- bard
  fixed the bard pulseincombat tag, it should do things in combat now
  moved all AAs to the DB
- /mode farm
  rof_shard_bodhe - will farm the quest in Shards Landing - Fear Begins at Home
  this is the no down time quest for shard farming for the tear.
  i highly advise you have a metric fucktonne of invis pots on you
  notes:
  - use at your own risk
  - if you cant solo these mobs normally, get a dps merc up or a healer
  - if you get to less then 40 Cloudy Potions, it will end
  - if your mesh sucks, it will do sucky things
- removed the stupid here echo in casting


200727.01

  I can open more on request


200712.02
- /heal break
  will watch the intended targets health. if it happens to hit the healpoint you have set for that class
  it will stop the cast and move on. the HP check is 3/second. this is only applied to spells and not
  items being used for healing.
- /buff shrink
  corrected a bad variable from all the tag changes
- redesign of mac start options
  https://entropy.exspes.com/wiki/index.php/Install#options

200710.01

- tag
  nuke::totem - marker for totem type spells, like shaman debuff totem, or necro skull aura totems.
- worked around a _bug_ thats causing some variables to not get defined properly
  things like curing and mana regen clicks will work again.. for now
- shaman
  shoudnt spam its checking its pet all the time
- bard
  removed an extra FALSE that was doing absolutly nothing. i mean, it could have just stayed ther forever


200709.02
- engage % logic issues
  so, toons with /cc mode heal and CC enabled, were getting past the engage % checks and going balls deep soon
  as something was targeted when they also had nuking/dotting/melee enabled. this should be resolved. now, they
  should only go balls deep with written permission
- tags
  more were found in buffing other merc/RL players. they have been corrected
- reversed the loginc in check_class_loop() so FALSE is actually bad now. not sure why it was good before


200709.01
- tags
  still missed a couple.. soo damn many of them.. #alwaysknightlysfault
  redesigned the class tag checks.. might work, might not. /shrug
  added in a twincast marker for twincast nukes
  corrected the nosafezone tag
  deleteing a tag will not readd it instantly as a delete evaluation
  removed the debug from deletes

  added:
	/tag buff::assist::your assist
	/tag heal::assist::your assist

- healing
  should break sooner when the threshold is reached for the grouphurt count to do a gorup heal
- bard
  corrected (read deleted) some old condition calls
- sql inits
  reversed the checks from errors 5/6 for fails on a db write to a 0 for a pass

- /entropy
  removed the dpsmeter option
- tags
  corrected the function calls to reflect new tag names for every class


200706.01
- lsProtectOutsideGroup - is now the only list for adding Players/NPCs to your XTarget list for healing
- /line command has been removed
  it is now part of the / commands that can use lines. for example.
  /heal line #|#|#|#|#
- popups (can't believe i'm doing this)
  there is now a popup for the /env auto command, showing its state
  when you start using the console in MQ2Next, it will make more sense

** tags and conditions.. you should probably read this. i mean, you dont have to, but it might help
** I broke all of your tags again.. sorry not sorry?
- conditions have been removed from Entropy. well, they are still there for reference. but the code no longer uses them
  so you can still do a /condition and see a list of the conditions you had created, but thats all it will do

- tags have now replaced conditions
  a tag contains 3 parts: its grouping, its name, and its evaluation
  example:
  buff::nocombat::!${Select[${Me.CombatState},combat]} && !${SpawnCount[npc radius ${maEnv.Find[stEnvSafeRadius].Value} playerstate 4]}
  groupings are limited and cannot be changed. and example of a grouping is buff or heal or nuke
  the tag name, there are some defaults, and others you can make. you cannot edit the defaults, you can make as many as you like
  the evalutaion is what you are checking, like "${Me.PctHPs} < 15"

  to create a tag you would do something like:
  /tag nuke novermin "${Me.House.RacoonBreakingIn} > 11pm"
  this would creat a tag for nukes that will kill the damn trashpanda that keeps getting in my cat door at nights.

- /tag
  /tag list - shows all tags/evals for all groupings
  /tag list heal - shows all tags/evals for the heal group
	/tag list 2 - shows only the tags/evals you have created

  /tag heal panic delete - will delete the panic evaluation from heals
  /tag panic delete - will delete the panic tag name.

  tags names have some basic colors to them
  green - default ones for use
  brown - markers for things like heal:self or buff:crew
  cyan - tags i did not include as markers or defualts (basically, yours or errors)

  NOTES:
  you cannot delete tag name without deleting the evaluation from all the groupings it is in first. if you try, it will yell at you
  you can have the same tag name in different groups doing different things
  there is no limit to the number of tags you can make
  to correct a tag evaluation, simply remake it
  any invalid tags will show some very irritating red warning notices, often
  as normal, it is up to you to create the evaluations correctly. ${Tuesday.Tacos} is not a valid eval, even though it should be
  tags are still applied the same way to things like /buff or /heal example
  /buff 1 tag tacos add

- /buff
  group - enable/disable group bufffing (not people in your crew aka your bots)

  buffraid - use this buff for raid buffing
  buffgroup - use this buff on groups
- cleric and shaman
  added a timer for regen (single and group) checks. default is every 3 seconds
  the routine check was simply consuming too much of the healers time
- pulling
  melee tagging is now a default value for range pulling if a pull brings you to
  within melee combat range due to a LoS check
- curing
  i broke it..again.. will unbreak soon..


B200512.01
- Pulling round 4... will get this some day...
- pull fetching
  added breaks for mob death
  added mob target change if agro while in route
- /cc pull (considerable changes to the control)

  groupassist - allow overriding yourself as a group assist to still use a manual assist
  scenario: 2 groups. 1 is a mob control group other is dps. dps group all assist the group ma
  the group ma sets ma1 to the tank in the control group and enables override groupassist
  this alows them to be both a group assist and still pull their assist from outside the group
  keeping all group exp to the dps group and avoiding a raid configuration
- bard

  added breaks in OOC singing in case combat happens

  cleric using Aura of the Reverent can use condition:
  !${Me.Aura[1].Name.Equal[Reverent Aura]} && !${Me.Aura[2].Name.Equal[Reverent Aura]}
  due to the DBG fucked up naming convention
- conditions
  i've built in the math.calc calculation into the condition check routine
  you should be able to go back to writing normal conditions an having them function as designed
  i'll leave it like this till the MQ issue is sorted (if ever...)
- /pull nav
  added a death check in the move back portion cause some SKs suck
- toons will buff you crew members again. the strike is over. agreements have been made

- /heal promise (work in progress)
- bard

B2004027.01
- Sphere of Fire (PoWar Raid) and Steel Mass (quest mob in argath) added to the noTargetNPC list
- undeleted the code i deleted for unity buffs.. dont ask..
- pulling
  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
  navpull has been adjusted so if you turn off the following
  /cc pull sethome
  /cc home incombat
  and clear your home marker /home clear
  nav pull will just wander to every mob and kill it.
	if you set the same settings for everyone your group and tie to the nav puller its kind of fun to watch
- nav pull wait time is now based off pull range and mob distance like all the pull modes
- /entropy buffcooldownwait
  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
  this switch forces a gem cooldown delay in order to force complete buff cycles w/o skiping to the next available buff
  THIS WILL slow down your toons response time as they will not break buff cycles (by default) on spell cooldowns
  it is applied to auras, minion, self, crew buffing
- healing (brace yourself)
	increased the heal map from 20 to 50
	the /heal map now covers target of target heals, splash heals (not surge thats later), regen heals (group and single), group heals, pet heals,
	add the heals just like you would nukes, dots whatever and tag them with the type of heal they are
	for the existing heals in your /heal list, you need to tag them as well. probably healsingle will cover them
- tags
	healsingle - single target heal (self or other)
	healgroup - group heal
	healhot - single target heal over time
	healgrouphot - group heal over time
	healtot - target of target heal
	healminion - minion (pet) heal
	healself - single target heal (self only)
  healsplash - splash heal (pally/cleric)
- buffs self/crew
  corrected an error in the blocked buffs check

- externalixed several distance ranges used throughout the macro
- rezing
  adjusted several checks to be a little more aggressive and reset faster when dead
  shortened all the rez recast times
  stResurrection is now in play. if you set this variable it will override all other rezing choices
  so, say you put the clicky 90% rez stick in there. it will use that over your normal rez aa.
  it will default to normal class AAs if stResurrection is not ready to be used
  /rez other - sets the thing you want to rez with (not required for rezing classes)
- pulling
  dying while in the waiting for mob to get to camp portion of a pull will reset you and the pull

- beastlord
  will no longer paragon or consume in a designated safe zone


B2004022.02
- pulling
  removed nav path checking for base pulling
  alterd the selection order to fail on mobs faster if they are in any of the zone lists
- /heal splash now limited to cleric and pally
- corrected MANY (read a fuck tonne) misspellings of petbuild debug (blame covid-19)
- pulling (pet)
  pet local environment range is now hard capped at 200. meaning,
  any mob over 200 in range, the pet owner will move closer to engage if petpulling
  you can still set pull ranges well in excess of 200
  you will get as close as you have set /cc pull navstop
  LoS is not a requirement
- beastlord
  consumption of spirit will now check for a pet
