ok, time to start this
- /cursor
  /cursor [see|keep|destroy|leave|ignore] "nameofitem" will set that item to that option in the database
  /cursor [see|keep|destroy|leave|ignore] with an item on the cursor will set that item to that option in the database
- /mode
  forage - forages shit. matches to lood databse and treats as set
  summon - will (while in lobby) go buy the summon item you need, take it to the summoner and summon your corpse. mode ends then
  drag - drags corpses. all the corpses.. seriously. all of them
  collect - goes and gets shineys. effectiveness is very reliant on your zone mesh
  scorch - NOT FOR USE IN NON NOOB ZONE!!
    - kills everything
    - obeys exclude list
    - reqires /env auto enabled
    - best to use with a high pull radius
    - follows /cc mode Range|Melee usage
  petfarm - NOT FOR USE IN NON NOOB ZONE!! 
    - sends pet to kill shit
    - if you increase your /cc pull rad ## over your pet range, you are stupid
    - obeys exclude list

  /build save "name" [all] - will save all DB fields for your character false or otherwise. good for making fast switching builds if you need. will still not save fields for character names
