  crews should not try to invite their friends either

  /mode farm MISSIONNAME
  can get a list of existing missions with `/aux farm`
  these will be a case by case design
- /build
  set - smaller version of a load. works off sets.ini in the data directory structured like the following:
  [clericraid]
  ; settings for a handsoff heal only cleric
  stCountArbitrate=0
  stCountSplash=1
  swBuffSelf=FALSE
  swBuffAmmo=FALSE
  swBuffBeg=FALSE
  swBuffCrew=FALSE
  swRezGive=FALSE
  swRezCombat=FALSE
  swHealXTarget=TRUE
	e.g. doing a /build set clericraid
	will load those settings directly. nothing else. can make as many sets as you like.
	DO NOT use for lists. least not yet.
	the point of this is speed and something simpler to use
	setting this up is completely manual

- debugs
  more updates to te debugs for pulling
  "cb" will debug the /cb command
- CHANGES TO CONDITIONS!!!!
  conditions are no longer attached as a +c# (+c4 or whatever) to the thing you are wanting to check.
  they are now their own entry e.g. stBuff5Con=#, # being the number of the condition you want to use
  application is the same, if the condition evaluates to FALSE then the whatever will not be done.
  setting a condition to 0 will disable the condition check. 0 is the default.
- /condition (new command)
  /condition 4 "!${Select[${Me.Class.ShortName},DRU]}" would add that condition to slot 4
  /condition 8 clear - would set the condition back to false/default
